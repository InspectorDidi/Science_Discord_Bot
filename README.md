Special cases aren't enough reasons to break rules,
errors shouldn't pass silently, unless explicitly silenced,
since that in the face of ambiguity, one must refuse the temptation to guess.
There should preferably be only one obvious way to do it,
however  obvious it may appear at first unless you're Dutch.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea,
besides namespaces being one honking idea.
